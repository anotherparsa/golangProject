simple todo project that I'm practicing for backend learning

I'm fully aware that this app has a lot of issues in the front-end side but I'm not focused on the front-end side since 
that's a whole another story and a separated stack.
I tried to just focus on the back-end side and tried to undrestand the concepts and the logic behind a web application.
after finishing this project, I'm going to start learning about APIs and delete the front-end side completely. 
since I had no previous experience in backend development. 
I tried to learn a lot of concepts, and surely I learnt a lot of things, I tried my best to understand the big picture of 
the backend development. I wrote almost everything without using any third-part packages to understand what is going on under the hood.
it was a challenging and hard experience but it was worthy.
I'm excited to start a new project and improve my skills and learn new concepts.
