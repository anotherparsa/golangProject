Romand numbers are represented by seven different symbols:
Symbol   Value
I        1
V        5
X        10
L        50
C        100
D        500
M       1000

There are some rules:
if a symbol with smaller value appears before a symbol with larger value you have to subtract.
if a symbol with larger value appears befor a symbol with smaller or equal value you have to add.
I only can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
X only can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
C only can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.
you can't put miltiple smaller values before a larger value
EX: 
you can't represent 999 as IM => 100 - 1 that's not valid according to the rules.
instead you use CMXCIX to represent 999 -> 1000 - 100 + 100 - 10 + 10 - 1 = 999
if you want represent 3 you can use III but if you want to represent 4 you can't use IIII you use IV
if you want to represent 9 you use IX => 10 - 1
if you want to represent 8 you use VIII => 5 + 1 + 1 + 1
II represent 2 => I + I => 1 + 1
LIII represent 53 => L + I + I => 50 + 1 + 1 +1
IV represent 4 => 5 - 1 => 4
There are no more than 3 times repeatation.
if you want represent 3 you can use III but if you want to represent 4 you can't use IIII you use IV
if you want to represent 9 you use IX => 10 - 1
if you want to represent 8 you use VIII => 5 + 1 + 1 + 1
in this problem we get a string which is the Romand representation of a number and convert it to the numerical representation.
then we declare a result int to keep the final Numerical number.
then we loop through the RomanNumber one by one.
we keep the one we're iterating in the current value and we check if I is smaller than the length of the RomanNumber minus one.
if the condition is meet that means there is another Roman Symbol that we have to decide to add or subtract.
if the current value is is smller than the next symbol then we have to subtract.
if the current value is bigger than the next symbol or simply there is no other symbol after it (in the condition) we just add it to the result.
