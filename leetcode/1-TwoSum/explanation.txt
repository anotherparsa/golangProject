there is an array with some numbers on it.
the goal is to find the indices of two numbers that adds up to the target.
for example if I have an array like this:
numbers = {3, 5, 1, 4, -8}
and the target = 5  
I have to find a pair of (x, y) in a way that x + y = 5

one approach is start from beginning and check every possible pair of 
number to see if the sum is queal to the target, until you find the solution.

EX:
Target = 5
number[0]=> 3 + numbers[1]=> 5 = 8 N
number[0]=> 3 + numbers[2]=> 1 = 4 N 
number[0]=> 3 + numbers[3]=> 4 = 7 N
number[0]=> 3 + numbers[4]=> -8 = -5 N
number[1]=> 5 + numbers[2]=> 1 = 6 N
number[1]=> 5 + numbers[3]=> 4 = 9 N
number[1]=> 5 + numbers[4]=> -8 = -3 N
number[2]=> 1 + numbers[3]=> 4 = 5 Y
number[2]=> 1 + numbers[4]=> -8 = -7 N
number[3]=> 4 + numbers[4]=> -8 = -4 N

in this example we can return numbers[2] and numbers[3]
beacause numbers[2] => 1 + numbers[3] => 4 = target => 5

we can use nested loop with two loops.
to check all the numbers combinations.
if the sum of i and j indices adds up to target 
then it returns an array with those indices

another approach is while evaluating the elements, we have access to the currently accessed element.
that means it can be true that current_value + x = target.
and we can calculate it by target - current_value = x
we just have to check if the x exists in the array or not.
if it does then we found the solution without the need to evaluate all possible combination.
we need to keep track of where we seen a specific number and for that we can use a map.
for example if I have an array like this:
numbers = {4, -2, 5, 0, 6, 3, 2, 7}
and the target = 1
and I have a formula like this 
current_value + x = Target
i start at 4 which means
4 + x = 1 => x = -3
I need to check if I've seen the -3 or not. but at the start the map is empty
but i write the map like this map{4 : 0} to remember that I've seen the number 4
at index 0 in case I found a number that 4 can be its x.
the next number is -2 which means.
-2 + x = 1 => x = 3
again I need to check if I've seen the 3 or not. I'll check the map and there is no result.
I'll go to the next number in the array and also put the -2 into the map for future use.
the next number is 5 which means:
5 + x = 1 => x = -4
I need to check if I've seen the -4 or not.
and you do this until you find the correct pair of numbers which in this case is :
{5, 1}
when you reach numbers[5] => 3 which means 
3 + x = 1 => x = -2 and when you check the map you can see you already seen the -2
at index 1.
